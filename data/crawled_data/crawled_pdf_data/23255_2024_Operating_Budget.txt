18 city of pittsburgh operating budget fiscal year 2024 budget guide overview of the government of the city of pittsburgh the government of the city of pittsburgh is composed independently elected and appointed officials who work alongside more than three thousand employees in the service of advancing the interests of city residents. the mayor and city controller are elected through a citywide vote. city council’s nine representatives are elected to office by residents in each of their respective districts. the office of the city controller is responsible for auditing all city expenditures in order to prevent wasteful or fraudulent practices. additionally, the city controller reviews and approves contracts and is also charged with reporting to the citizens of pittsburgh, the mayor, and city council the state of the city’s fiscal condition. every year, the city controller issues the annual comprehensive financial report, which provides detailed information on pittsburgh’s short-term and long-term financial outlook. city council proposes, deliberates, and votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the city. this body also approves appointments, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final operating and capital budgets. city council is responsible for the introduction of legislation generated by the administrative branch of city government and may also introduce legislation from individual council members to the body as a whole. city council as a body provides council with centralized staff support under the direction of the city clerk. the city clerk, with the help of the records management division, serves as a centralized document and information resource to council, all city departments, and the residents of the city of pittsburgh. the city council budget division monitors city finances and conducts independent analyses of city operations. it prepares and distributes to council periodic reports on revenues, expenditures, and other trends relating to the fiscal condition of the city of pittsburgh. it supervises and reviews city council's annual operating and capital budgets and compiles special reports and executive summaries to assist members in their deliberations. the office of the mayor is the largest branch of the government of the city of pittsburgh and is directly responsible for much of the city’s daily operations. this work is performed by individual departments, offices, bureaus, and commissions. the services provided by these entities range from public safety and public works to debt management. many of these departments focus on specific services. for example, the department of law acts as a legal advisor to the mayor, city council, and other departments. two units act as umbrella organizations. the department of public safety bureau of administration oversees the bureaus of police, fire, emergency medical services, and animal care and control, as well as the office of community health and safety. similarly, the department of public works bureau of administration oversees the bureaus of operations, environmental services, and facilities. additionally, there are seven governmental units which fall within the office of the mayor in the city’s managerial hierarchy but whose sources of financing exist outside of the city’s general fund. for this reason, these authorities are not included in the operating budget. a comprehensive visualization of the government of the city of pittsburgh is included in the organization chart presented in this document. 19 city of pittsburgh operating budget fiscal year 2024 budget guide what is the operating budget? the operating budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. reported within this document are figures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year. expenditures are spread across all city departments, bureaus, and elected offices. these expenditures represent costs for the administration and distribution of governmental services. these services include, but are not limited to: public safety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and programming for local parks and community recreation centers. in addition, the general fund also supports the routine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers’ compensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service. the city collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents. revenues are collected by the city from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses, charges for services provided by city departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other revenue generating mechanisms. the operating budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what governmental services can be executed by the city and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal year. the detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the city of pittsburgh in delivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed. the operating budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the mayor and members of city council. laws established by the commonwealth of pennsylvania restrict how much money the city of pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. as a result, the city of pittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire through tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms. given the reality of scarce resources, the city must prioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the city. the level of funding allocated to individual departments and programs within the city clearly exhibits priorities set by the city’s elected public officials. finally, the operating budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. all of the costs incurred by the city of pittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the operating budget. therefore, the city of pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. the operating budget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those enacted in the initial creation of the plan. basis of accounting the general fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the city of pittsburgh recognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid. the fiscal year the city of pittsburgh’s fiscal year begins on the first day of january and ends on the last day of december of each year. this can only be changed by ordinance. balanced budget mandate the city’s home rule charter requires that the annual operating budget be balanced, with estimated revenues equal to or greater than estimated expenditures. should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year, the budget surplus is transferred into the city’s reserve fund balance. 20 city of pittsburgh operating budget fiscal year 2024 budget guide the city’s fund structure in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the city’s financial reporting system is organized on a fund basis consisting of two major types of funds: governmental and fiduciary. governmental funds general fund capital projects fund community development funds special revenues funds fiduciary funds pension trust fund agency funds the general fund is the main operating fund for the city. it includes most tax revenues and is used to sustain most of the city’s day-to-day activities, including public safety, public works, parks, planning, and general administration. the capital projects fund is used to fund construction and/or maintenance of any public property, facility, or program (such as buildings, park facilities, infrastructure, information technology systems) that is expected to provide a long-term benefit to the city. all projects funded by debt should meet two requirements: a minimum value of $50,000 and a life expectancy greater than five years. funding for the capital projects fund comes from three major sources: pay-as-you-go (paygo) funding, bonds, and state and federal funds. for more detail on the capital budget and what it funds, please refer to the 2024 capital budget document. community development funds are funded primarily by the federal department of housing and urban development (hud). these funds are earmarked for projects relating to housing, economic development, and human services needs in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low- to moderate-income households. special revenue funds are funds in which a substantial portion of the proceeds or inflows are restricted or committed for a specific purpose. examples of these include the liquid fuels fund, the pittsburgh partnership fund, and the grants fund. while they are included in this document, the city only sets formal appropriations for two of the funds: the stop the violence fund, and the parks tax fund. although many of these include the word “trust” in their titles, this is more of an informal recognition that the funds are designated for special purposes; the funds are not held by any trustees or custodians. fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government. these resources are not available to support the city of pittsburgh’s own operations and are custodial in nature. the city’s pension plans and its agency funds fall under this type of fund. • the city administers three pensions for full time employees: one for police officers, a second for firefighters, and a third for municipal employees. • agency funds include accounts held for employee benefits, payroll withholding, escheats, and tax refunds. the workers compensation veba (voluntary employee beneficiary account), the opeb (other post-employment benefits) trust fund, and real estate tax refunds trust funds are examples of fiduciary funds. budget allocations this budget document divides total expenditures across the elected offices, departments, and bureaus that comprise the government of the city. individual divisions carry out unique tasks. 21 city of pittsburgh operating budget fiscal year 2024 budget guide the city utilizes a hierarchical chart of accounts to distribute funds to each department, bureau, agency, and elected office. these accounts are organized by levels of detail, with the individual object accounts being the most specific: fund ... cost center ... subclass ... object account the legal appropriations in the operating budget refer to the general fund, which is coded as 11101. costs are next delineated by distributing funds across the city’s divisions,

budget fiscal year 2024 budget guide the chart of accounts delineates these subclasses into further detail called object accounts. object accounts are the most detailed level to which the city of pittsburgh budgets. expenditures are both budgeted and recorded using the account string depicted below. the account string begins by identifying the fund, followed by the cost center (city division), subclass (expenditure category), object account (expenditure category detail), and fiscal year. below is an example account string that represents expenditures related to postage for the department of

generated by both tax and non-tax sources. there are seven subclasses. revenues 41 tax revenue 42 license and permit revenue 43 charges for services 44 fines and forfeitures 45 intergovernmental revenue 46 interest earnings 47 miscellaneous revenues tax revenue taxes comprise the majority of city of pittsburgh revenues. in addition to wage and property taxes, there are many that are generated by the wide range of services, institutions, and entertainment available within the city. they are collected from both residents of the city of pittsburgh as well as nonresidents, when appropriate. real estate taxes are the single largest source of tax revenue. the city collects them on behalf of the city, school district, and the carnegie library of pittsburgh. real estate taxes are levied on land and buildings located within the city of pittsburgh. assessments are conducted at the county level by the allegheny county office of property assessments and the tax is collected based on the fair market value of property. as of 2023, the city real estate tax rate is 8.06 mills, the school district real estate tax rate is 10.25 mills, and the carnegie library real estate tax rate is 0.25 mills. tax relief is provided through various programs including the homestead exemption (allegheny county act 50 of 1998) and senior tax relief (allegheny county act 77 of 2000). other sources of tax revenue for the city of pittsburgh are the earned income tax, the payroll preparation tax, the parking tax, the local service tax, the amusement tax and non-resident sports facility usage fee, the deed transfer tax, the public service privilege tax, and the institution and service privilege tax. earned income tax is a conventional 3 percent wage tax applied to city and school district residents who earn wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, or other net profits in a given year. city residents pay a 1 percent city tax and a 2 percent school district tax. interest, dividends, active duty pay from the armed forces, pensions, social security, and capital gains are commonly excluded. the payroll preparation tax was initiated following the city of pittsburgh’s entry into act 47 in 2003 and is levied at the rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers and the distribution of net income from self-employed individuals, members of partnerships, associations, joint ventures or other entities who perform work or provide services within the city of pittsburgh. nonprofit and other charitable organizations are excluded from this tax. 23 city of pittsburgh operating budget fiscal year 2024 budget guide finally, the parking tax is collected from users of private and public parking facilities located within the city of pittsburgh. a portion of the parking tax is dedicated to the city of pittsburgh’s pension fund until 2051. in 2022, actual tax revenue totaled $537,692,183, or 76.5 percent of total city revenue. city of pittsburgh voters approved a referendum in 2019 to add 0.50 mills to the real estate tax to collect funds for the improvement of the city's parks. these funds are not deposited into the general fund. please see the stop the violence trust fund section for more information. non-tax revenue “non-tax revenue” is a catch-all term referring to funding mechanisms utilized by the city of pittsburgh that do not directly involve the levying of taxes. residents may be familiar with examples such as building construction permits and liquor and malt beverage licenses. however, there are other types of non-tax revenue, such as interest earnings on investments, that are less visible. generally, the two largest subclasses of non-tax revenue for the city of pittsburgh come from intergovernmental sources and license and permit fees. each year, the city of pittsburgh receives funding from federal, state, and local government sources in the form of grants, aid, and reimbursements for services performed. for example, the liquid fuels tax object account consists of funds received from the state and offsets some of the costs of road maintenance and road salt. most intergovernmental funding comes from the commonwealth of pennsylvania in the form of pension aid. local entities, such as the pittsburgh parking authority and the pittsburgh water and sewer authority, and federal agencies also contribute to intergovernmental revenue. in utilizing this funding, the city's goal is to enhance the quality of municipal services and reduce the city's financial burden. many city departments provide various services for which rent or fees are charged. examples of these fees include payments for safety inspections, copying city documents, rents from city properties, and the use or sale of rights of way. in addition, the city is compensated for services provided to other municipalities and governmental entities. for example, emergency medical services collects fees after it transports individuals to receive medical care. in 2022, actual non-tax revenue totaled $165,191,649, or 23.5 percent of total city revenue. how does the city spend money? the tax and non-tax revenue collected annually by the city of pittsburgh is used to provide services to residents ranging from refuse pick-up to the regular maintenance of capital assets. expenditures are monitored by department or division and by subclass. major expenditures include health insurance costs, pension payments, and workers’ compensation claims for city of pittsburgh employees. the operating budget also pays the principal and interest costs associated with past and current issuance of debt generated by previous and ongoing capital projects and other programs. the chart below illustrates historic costs associated with debt service, pension and other post-employment benefits (opeb) contributions, health insurance and workers’ compensation. 24 )snoillim( $ city of pittsburgh operating budget fiscal year 2024 budget guide select major expenditures, 2018-2022 150,000,000

previously issued municipal bonds in order to ensure their timely retirement. debt service exists as its own subclass within the department of finance and is composed of the following accounts: debt service 82101 interest expense - bonds 82103 principal budget creation process the operating budget development cycle begins in late spring, when the office of management and budget (omb) forwards a memorandum detailing the budget preparation process and general high level expectations, policy goals, and citywide strategic initiatives to all city divisions. omb also holds public meetings, as required by city code. after receiving baseline budgets from omb, individual divisions work with their budget analysts to draft and submit proposals. each division presents budget proposals to omb. these proposals include current year achievements, requests for general and project-specific funding, and personnel position changes. the mayor reviews the proposals to ensure that requests align with citywide goals and strategic plans/initiatives and decides which, if any, should be funded. the mayor releases a preliminary budget at the end of september. omb hosts additional public meetings to garner feedback. if fiscal conditions allow for changes, revisions are made. when the proposals and the mayor’s strategic initiatives are aligned, the mayor formally submits both budgets to city council in november. city council reviews the budget and holds a number of meetings and televised hearings with each division. after consideration of public input and member priorities, city council makes changes to the budget and then holds a vote to adopt the budget. this must occur before december 31st. failure to enact a budget prior to january 1st of the new year means that the city cannot pay any vendors, cannot undertake any projects, and cannot (subject to collective bargaining agreements) pay any employees. the last time a budget was not approved before december 31st was 1931. upon adoption, omb is responsible for implementing and overseeing the city of pittsburgh’s operating and capital budgets. throughout the fiscal year, omb monitors the city’s expenditures and revenues, provides legislative oversight on any matters related to the budget, and oversees budget transfers and adjustments. analysts in omb prepare quarterly reports on the performance of major revenue sources and expenditure categories, reports on key factors driving the budget, reports on cash flow, and brief updates on important management initiatives. 26 city of pittsburgh operating budget fiscal year 2024 budget guide five-year financial forecast in addition to developing the budget, omb and the department of finance are responsible for estimating both expenditures and revenues for the four years following the next fiscal year. together, these estimates comprise the five-year financial forecast reported in the budget document. the five-year forecast allows city officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the city for a longer period of time. this aids in identifying any future trends related to revenues and/or expenditures that may have an immediate or long- term impact on city operations. in addition, the five-year plan is used by city decision makers when planning for long-term strategies, formulating departmental and citywide initiatives, and developing new policies that might result in a financial impact. the financial forecast is an essential tool in maintaining financial discipline, thus ensuring the delivery of essential services to residents of the city of pittsburgh. revenue forecast revenues represent the available resources afforded to the city to carry out basic administrative operations and deliver services to city residents. the ability of the city of pittsburgh to generate revenue is governed by the rights afforded to the city under its home rule charter and by the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania. projected future year expenditures are directly influenced by future year revenues projections. the department of finance utilizes a variety of techniques and information sources to develop revenue forecasts. previous years’ financial data is used to forecast growth for major tax and non-tax revenues. monthly and end-of- year financial data related to all revenues are archived and updated in the city’s enterprise resource planning (erp) system. this information is then analyzed through statistical methods to ascertain growth in each revenue line. where applicable, the city then applies a growth rate to each revenue line. in addition to the previous years’ financial data, the city consults with ihs markit to forecast regional economic variables. these economic variables help to inform how various aspects of the economy can affect revenue generating activity in the city. the city also incorporates data from federal government agencies such as the bureau of economic analysis and the bureau of labor statistics and organizations such as fannie mae, the national association of realtors, and realstats. revenue projections are finalized after a series of meetings with various stakeholders related to the city of pittsburgh’s operating budget. the city controller verifies that budgetary assumptions and estimates are developed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and that revenue assumptions are reasonable. following consensus by all stakeholders in the budget development process, the revenue projections are finalized and incorporated into the five-year financial forecast. expenditure forecast omb is responsible for developing the expenditure projections for the five-year forecast. to develop these forecasts omb first enters all known future year expenditures into its budget management software. these known expenditures are those that are either contractual (professional service contracts, debt service payments, pension contributions, etc.) or generally predictable (staffing levels in each department, citywide salary increases, etc.). omb then develops forecasts which consider past year expenditure data and future growth, strategies, and initiatives. while most costs remain relatively static some expenditures lines, such as healthcare and fuel, are subject to growth in future years. these increases are largely a product of costs rising in the private market. this is accounted for in the financial forecast by applying a percentage growth each year based on trend, lastly, the directors of each city division present any requests that are not captured by the methods described above. these requests are often related to software, equipment, or personnel and are regarded to be essential in achieving the goals or augmenting the services of each individual department. omb compiles all such requests and evaluates how they relate to the mayor’s strategic initiatives. subject to available funds, those requests that fall in line with the citywide initiatives are funded in each respective division’s budget in the five-year forecast. 27 city of pittsburgh operating budget fiscal year 2024 budget guide how to read the budget throughout this budget document, financial data is illustrated in a variety of ways. in general, each separate section of the document reports the same financial data. the level of detail is the only substantial difference between each report within a section. departmental sections the most detailed and specific illustration of the general fund operating budget financial data can be found in the departmental sections of the document. this section details funds by subclass and account that have been appropriated to each individual division. the following are the different components that in aggregate make up the departmental sections of the operating budget. 28 city of pittsburgh operating budget fiscal year 2024 budget guide organization chart the organization chart is a visual depiction of the functional areas within each city department, agency, bureau, or elected office that are responsible for the execution of services and programs. the chart is very general; with the exception of directors or other managers, the chart does not identify individual positions. departmental overview at the beginning of each departmental section, readers will find a mission statement which defines the organization. the mission statement is followed by an overview that provides a detailed description of the department. this section of the narrative describes different functional areas within each department, agency, bureau, or elected office and their associated services or programs. current year accomplishments are listed. position summary the position summary lists all of the budgeted jobs within the organization. the full-time equivalent, or “fte,” represents the number of full-time workers in the position. the “rate/grade” category indicates how an employee’s pay level is calculated. grade and step plans for non-union employees and afscme 2719 employees can be found as an appendix to this document. for full time positions, a “12” in the “hours/months” column indicates that the position is budgeted for all 12 months in the year. smaller numbers indicate a position starting or ending mid-year. for part time positions, the number in this column represents budgeted hours of work. the “budget” column highlights the total amount, in dollars, that is allocated to pay all personnel in that position. the “vacancy allowance” adjusts the subclass expenditures to account for savings associated with vacant positions throughout the year. a summary from 2023 is also included to facilitate comparisons. subclass detail this portion of the departmental budget includes 2022 actual expenditures and budget numbers at the subclass and object account level. for example, the general “professional and technical services” subclass will highlight the appropriation amounts for specific accounts, such as “administrative fees,” “workforce training,” and “computer maintenance.” readers can easily compare budgeted expenditures from 2023 with budgeted expenditures for 2024. the final columns shows the difference and percent difference between the 2023 and 2024 budgeted amounts. under the personnel – salaries & wages subclass, there are several important details. regular salary represents the total base pay for the organization. longevity pay is awarded to employees in certain collective bargaining agreements based on seniority and tenure. salary allowances are used to pay for part-time, temporary, or seasonal workers, as well as student interns. when uniform allowances are paid directly to employees, their costs are listed accordingly. leave buyback represents sick leave hours that can be “sold back” to the city. premium pay appropriations compensate for overtime hours. reimbursements are funds from outside sources that are used to offset certain position expenses. five-year forecasts finally, the five-year forecast allows readers to consider what the city expects to spend in the future. in addition to the 2024 budget, there are projections for 2025 through 2028. the percent change from the prior year is included as a reference point. note for fund accounts for special revenue accounts that are included in the operating budget, the fiscal year 2024 summary is composed of the “projected beginning balance” for january 1, 2024, anticipated revenues and expenditures, and the “projected ending balance” for december 31, 2024. these funds carry over from year to year. a position summary follows when appropriate. 29 five-year financial forecast 30 city of pittsburgh operating budget fiscal year 2024 five-year financial

percent on average per year, more in line with historical growth. the largest taxpayer incentives that reduce current year real estate tax liability are the homestead exemption, the allegheny county

minimum municipal obligation (mmo) to reach the actuarial recommended contribution (arc) • continuing efforts of responsible borrowing with the city’s debt burden totaling 10.1 percent of general fund expenditures in 2024 • allocating a $22.0 million in "pay-as-you-go" (paygo) transfer to the capital improvement plan in addition to the information outlined in the revenue and expenditure sections of

department. • debt service: the forecast assumes that with the significant reduction in debt service that occurred in 2019, the city will be able to responsibly issue bonds each year to address the city’s critical infrastructure needs. • paygo: the city funds a number of capital projects through a transfer from the general fund into the capital projects fund each year. paygo (or “pay-as-you-go”) transfers are funds that the city spends on capital projects that may not be eligible for bond or community development funds. in the 2024 capital improvement plan, projects funded with paygo are mainly focused on neighborhood improvement, economic development, and blight remediation. the forecast assumes that the city will continue to contribute paygo funds for capital projects consistent with chapter 218 of the city code, contributing $22 million in 2024 and a total of $21.1 million from 2025 to 2028. most non-personnel related subclasses are projected to remain relatively flat or increase modestly throughout fiscal year 2028. debt service will decrease significantly in 2027. 2024-2028 spending by subclass $800,000,000 $600,000,000 51 personnel-salaries & wages 52

2026 2027 2028 the 2024 operating budget and five-year plan achieves substantial improvements in terms of the percentage of total expenditures related to debt service. in fiscal year 2015 expenditures related to debt service reached $89,289,167. this represented 18.6 percent of total budgeted expenditures. in the 2024 operating budget, total planned expenditures related to debt service is $69,390,272, or 10.1 percent of total budgeted expenditures. this trend illustrates the city’s commitment to long term financial health. the long term impact of this plan will allow the city to responsibly borrow at more favorable rates, comply with the city’s debt policy, and provide resources to invest in the city’s assets. 54 city of pittsburgh operating budget fiscal year 2024

improve community safety and well-being, and support public safety personnel by building a public health-informed response continuum. departmental/bureau overview the office of community health and safety is focused on building a response continuum and developing sustainable upstream interventions to address unmet community social service needs that often fall to public safety personnel, who represent the 24/7 safety net response. through partnerships and program development, the office will focus on: developing a continuum of support: through continued collaboration with first responders and community members, analysis of calls for service, mapping of existing services, development of new partnerships, and evaluation of existing models, the office of community health & safety (och&s) will establish a continuum of resources and responders to address community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by public safety partners. first responder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis will be utilized to build this continuum. implementation of public health-informed practices: public safety personnel consistently respond to community needs that exceed what they can provide in a single engagement model; however, first responders have significant exposure to issues that affect community members’ health and well-being. och&s will work with the department of public safety, public health entities, and academic partners to evaluate new programs and responses to proactively address issues (especially upstream interventions) and reduce harm experienced by community members. additionally, partners will evaluate best practices, facilitate focus groups, and elevate translational experiences. consistent community engagement and partnership: continued community engagement, transparency, and accountability to the community and first responders is critical to building trust and facilitating change in the current response continuum. och&s will create a collaborative model of program development and evaluation, prioritizing continuous review to ensure that deficits are quickly addressed and used for growth. och&s will partner with existing community organizations and prioritize community members who have been harmed and may not engage in traditional meetings. initial efforts will focus on creation of multiple advisory collaboratives focused on black neighborhoods most harmed by the war on drugs and systemic racism. note: the office of community health full time positions can be found

director and establishes the comprehensive vision, guiding policies and permitted uses of the urban mobility network and public rights of way. it is comprised of three divisions: • planning - oversees development of system plans and multimodal networks and collaborates on implementation; develops conceptual design of transportation facilities; gathers and analyzes data on the condition and use of the mobility system; coordinates with county and regional organizations and entities to plan transportation infrastructure improvements and mobility systems; and serves as the initial point of contact for public stakeholders and partners for general mobility concerns or initiatives. additionally, the planning division tracks development of the regional transportation improvement program (tip), development of the department’s submission to the city’s capital improvement plan, and pursuit of grants and other resources to support implementation of the transportation program. • policy - develops, communicates and maintains policies for the use, management, design and oversight of public mobility services, transportation facilities and public rights of way; manages demand on the

fiscal year 2024 999900 mission the independent citizen police review board ("cprb") promotes responsible citizenship and respectable law enforcement through mutual accountability. the broad mandate of the citizen police review board is to provide independent review of the conduct of the pittsburgh bureau of police. to accomplish this assignment, the board will thoroughly investigate specific allegations of misconduct, hold public hearings to examine such allegations; evaluate current police procedures and promote safe, professional and effective law enforcement practices through public education on rights, responsibilities and police authority; and make recommendations to the mayor and chief of police regarding police policies and procedures. a board comprised of seven members appointed by the mayor and city council presides over the work of the staff and determines all final dispositions of cases. the board conducts public hearings and renders findings and recommendations to the chief of police and mayor as related to the matter or complaint under review. departmental/bureau overview investigation and complaint disposition - citizens must file a notice of intent to file a citizen complaint with the cprb within six months of the incident from which the complaint arises. upon contact from a citizen, the intake coordinator evaluates the complaint for administrative compliance and initiates the internal case management of the complaint. the intake coordinator informs the complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities related to the complaint. the executive director or the assistant executive director reviews each citizen complaint, develops a preliminary investigative plan and assigns the case to an investigator. the assistant executive director provides daily supervision and oversight of case investigations. investigators conduct preliminary inquiries into cases and the results are presented to the board. the board considers the evidence and determines whether to further an investigation into the allegations of misconduct or to dismiss the complaint. complaints may proceed through investigation to a public hearing at the board’s discretion. findings and recommendations resulting from public hearings are forwarded to the mayor and chief of police who must respond to the board. patterns emerging from complaints and allegations of misconduct may be presented to the board for consideration of policy recommendations to the chief of police and mayor. community education - the goal of community education and outreach is to improve relations between citizens and police by developing or enhancing common knowledge of police authority, practices and procedures, and civilian expectations of police conduct. outreach utilizes printed material, traditional and social media, and personal appearances of members and staff to ensure the public has an opportunity to be informed of the cprb’s role and common rights and responsibilities of citizenship. the effort directed to citizens (1) ensures that the public is adequately prepared to respond to police encounters in a manner conducive to the safety of the citizen and the officer, and (2) conveys information on filing complaints when such encounters are perceived as offensive. the outreach to police officers is designed to encourage participation in investigations, explain the process, and integrate their concerns into the community education effort. board and staff development - training for members encompasses topics mandated by city ordinance, including police training, police policies and procedures, criminal, civil and constitutional law as well as human rights and contemporary practices of civilian review of law enforcement policies and police behavior. staff training is designed to enhance investigative skills, utilize technology for research and case management, and develops mediation and conciliation skills as well as crisis management and safety skills. staff adheres to the standards and performance objectives expected of certified police oversight professionals. administrative - the executive director is responsible for administering the policies and procedures of the board and those of the city which affect the daily operation of the independent citizen police review board. activities of this core service include the planning, organization, development, evaluation, and implementation of efficient and effective management strategies of fiscal, personnel, information systems, and related support to maximize the utility of the resources available. the assistant executive director facilitates daily administrative communication and serves as liaison to the administrative departments of the city. 242 city of

city of pittsburgh’s grants office is situated within the office of management and budget and is tasked with centralizing the city’s grant-seeking efforts as well as providing guidance and oversight to city departments in managing their post-award grant administration and reporting processes. the mission of the grants office is to increase the city’s capacity to compete for federal, state, county, corporate, and foundation grants and to effectively assist in the full life-cycle of grant management from award through closeout. the aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the city’s exposure to any grant-related legal liability, and improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars. the grants office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to expand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the city’s operating and capital budgets. grant funds received by the city of pittsburgh support important programs and services that the city provides to our community. these funds allow the city to extend pre-existing services, introduce new initiatives, gain technological advances, and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment. grant funds are dispersed throughout the city and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services, recreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others. because grant funding allows the city to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the impact of grant funding upon the city of pittsburgh is significant. in 2023, the city of pittsburgh was awarded 31 new awards for a total of $31,823,429 in funding. some projects supported by this funding include the reconnecting communities grant for improvements in manchester, funding to rehabilitate a downtown park, and safety improvements at the intersection of liberty avenue and the bloomfield bridge supported by a state grant award.. new grants by department, office, or bureau 7.2% 18.9% 4.9% 4.4% dpw budget 0.3% innovation and performance
