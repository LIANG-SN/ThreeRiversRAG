[ 7 ] it anchors the pittsburgh metropolitan area , which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the ohio valley and appalachia , the second-largest in pennsylvania , and the 26th-largest in the u.s. pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater pittsburgh–weirton–steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of ohio and west virginia . pittsburgh is known as "the steel city" for its dominant role in the history of the u.s. steel industry . [ 8 ] it developed as a vital link of the atlantic coast and midwest , as the mineral-rich allegheny mountains led to the region being contested by the french and british empires, virginians , whiskey rebels , and civil war raiders . [ 9 ] for part of the 20th century, pittsburgh was behind only new york city and chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most u.s. stockholders per capita. [ 10 ] deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city. [ 11 ] however, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the university of pittsburgh medical center and allegheny health network , as well as 68 colleges and universities , including carnegie mellon university and the university of pittsburgh . [ 14 ] the area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense , software engineering , robotics , energy research , and the nuclear navy . [ 15 ] the city is home to ten fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 u.s. law firms. pittsburgh is sometimes called the "city of bridges" for its 446 bridges . [ 8 ] its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the carnegie museums of pittsburgh , pittsburgh zoo & aquarium , phipps conservatory and botanical gardens , the national aviary , and a diverse cultural district . [ 16 ] the city's major league professional sports teams include the pittsburgh steelers , pittsburgh penguins , and pittsburgh pirates . pittsburgh is additionally where jehovah's witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 g20 pittsburgh summit . etymology [ edit ] main article: name of pittsburgh pittsburgh was named in 1758, by scottish general john forbes , in honor of british statesman william pitt, 1st earl of chatham . as forbes was a scotsman , he probably pronounced the name / ˈ p ɪ t s b ər ə / pits -bər-ə (similar to edinburgh ). [ 17 ] [ 18 ] pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on april 22, 1794, with the following act: [ 19 ] "be it enacted by the pennsylvania state senate and pennsylvania house of representatives of the commonwealth of pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of pittsburgh for ever." [ 20 ] from 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as "pittsburg", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations. [ 21 ] [ 17 ] after a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed. [ 17 ] the pittsburg press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921. [ 22 ] history [ edit ] main article: history of pittsburgh for a chronological guide, see timeline of pittsburgh . historical claims kingdom of france 1690s–1763 great britain 1681–1781 united states 1776–present native americans [ edit ] the area of the ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the shawnee and several other settled groups of native americans . [ 23 ] shannopin's town was an 18th-century lenape (delaware) town located roughly from where penn avenue is today, below the mouth of two mile run, from 30th street to 39th street. according to george croghan , the town was situated on the south bank of the allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as washington's landing, formerly herr's island , in what is now the lawrenceville neighborhood. [ 24 ] : 289 18th century [ edit ] further information: pennsylvania in the american revolution fort pitt block house , built by the british in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in pittsburgh. the first known european to enter the region was the french explorer robert de la salle from quebec during his 1669 expedition down the ohio river . [ 25 ] [ better source needed ] european pioneers, primarily dutch, followed in the early 18th century. michael bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year european fur traders established area posts and settlements. [ 26 ] in 1749, french soldiers from quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite canada with french louisiana via the rivers. [ 26 ] during 1753–1754, the british hastily built fort prince george before a larger french force drove them off. the french built fort duquesne based on lasalle's 1669 claims. the french and indian war , the north american front of the seven years' war , began with the future pittsburgh as its center. british general edward braddock was dispatched with major george washington as his aide to take fort duquesne. [ 27 ] the british and colonial force were defeated at braddock's field . general john forbes finally took the forks in 1758. he began construction on fort pitt , named after william pitt the elder , while the settlement was named "pittsborough". [ 28 ] during pontiac's war , a loose confederation of native american tribes laid siege to fort pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after colonel henry bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the battle of bushy run . bouquet strengthened the defenses of fort pitt the next year. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] during this period, the powerful nations of the iroquois confederacy , based in new york, had maintained control of much of the ohio valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. by the terms of the 1768 treaty of fort stanwix , the penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the iroquois . a 1769 survey referenced the future city as the "manor of pittsburgh". [ 33 ] both the colony of virginia and the province of pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the mason–dixon line westward, placing pittsburgh in pennsylvania. on march 8, 1771, bedford county, pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier. on april 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as pitt township . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] william teagarden was the first constable, and william troop was the first clerk. [ 36 ] following the american revolution , the village of pittsburgh continued to grow. one of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the ohio country . in 1784, thomas vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the penn family attorney. pittsburgh became a possession of pennsylvania in 1785. the following year, the pittsburgh post-gazette was started, and in 1787, the pittsburgh academy was chartered. unrest during the whiskey rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. by 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. settlers arrived after crossing the appalachian mountains or through the great lakes . fort pitt (now pittsburgh) at the source of the ohio river became the main base for settlers moving into the northwest territory . 19th century [ edit ] further information: pennsylvania in the american civil war the monongahela river and its surroundings in 1857 lithograph of pittsburgh by otto krebs (before 1874) burning of union depot during the pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877 the federal government recognizes pittsburgh as the starting point for the lewis and clark expedition . [ 37 ] preparations began in pittsburgh in 1803 when meriwether lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the missouri river . [ 38 ] the war of 1812 cut off the supply of british goods, stimulating american industry. by 1815, pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. on march 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. it was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers. in the 1830s, many welsh people from the merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the merthyr rising . by the 1840s, pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the allegheny mountains . the great fire of pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. the city rebuilt with the aid of irish immigrants who came to escape the great famine . by 1857, pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of european immigrants to the area, with the most coming from germany . because pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the revolution, enslaved african americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the south, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. there were active stations of the underground railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and african-american workers in city hotels. the drennen slave girl walked out of the monongahela house in 1850, apparently to freedom. [ 39 ] the merchant's hotel was also a place where african-american workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the underground railroad. [ 40 ] sometimes refugee slaves from the south stayed in pittsburgh, but other times they continued north, including into canada. many slaves left the city and county for canada after congress passed the 1850 fugitive slave act , as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. from 1850 to 1860, the black population in allegheny county dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in canada. [ 39 ] the american civil war boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the union. andrew carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the edgar thomson steel works in north braddock, pennsylvania , which evolved into the carnegie steel company . he adopted the bessemer process to increase production. manufacturing was key to growth of pittsburgh and the surrounding region. railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets. 20th century [ edit ] an aerial view of pittsburgh in 1902 [ 41 ] steel mills in the strip district in 1906 in 1901, j. p. morgan and attorney elbert h. gary merged carnegie steel company and several other companies into u.s. steel . by 1910, pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city , accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output. the pittsburgh agreement was subscribed in may 1918 between the czech and slovak nationalities, as envisioned by t. g. masaryk , concerning the future foundation of czechoslovakia . [ 42 ] the city suffered severe flooding in march 1936. the city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous european immigrants to its industrial jobs. by 1940, non-hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population. [ 43 ] pittsburgh also became a main destination of the african-american great migration from the rural south during the first half of the 20th century. [ 44 ] limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers. [ 45 ] during world war ii , demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort. [ 28 ] this resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. the city's reputation as the "arsenal of democracy" [ 46 ] [ 47 ] was being overshadowed by james parton 's 1868 observation of pittsburgh being "hell with the lid off." [ 48 ] following world war ii, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "renaissance," cleaning up the air and the rivers. the "renaissance ii" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. the industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. there were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures. [ 11 ] in the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. although pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. while 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again. 21st century [ edit ] during the late 2000s recession , pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. it was one of the few cities in the united states to see housing property values rise. between 2006 and 2011, the pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (msa) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the united states, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values. [ 49 ] in september 2009, the 2009 g20 pittsburgh summit was held in pittsburgh.

[ 53 ] bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. the great allegheny passage and chesapeake and ohio canal towpath connect the city directly to downtown washington, d.c. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail. cityscape [ edit ] main articles: downtown pittsburgh , north side (pittsburgh) , south side (pittsburgh) , and west end (pittsburgh) see also: list of pittsburgh neighborhoods , list of tallest buildings in pittsburgh , list of city of pittsburgh historic designations , and list of pittsburgh history and landmarks foundation historic landmarks pittsburgh's 90 distinct neighborhoods east carson street in the south side flats shadyside neighborhood the city consists of the downtown area, called the golden triangle, [ 54 ] and four main areas surrounding it—central, north side/north hills, south side/south hills, east end, and west end. these areas are further divided into 90 neighborhoods.

[ 81 ] [ 82 ] however, united states environmental protection agency (epa) data from 2021 to 2024 shows that pittsburgh's air quality was generally good or moderate. [ 83 ] [ 84 ] despite improvements, studies suggest pittsburgh's air quality still impacts health. a 2014 to 2016 study found that children near pollution sources like industrial sites had asthma rates nearly three times the national average. [ 85 ] it also revealed that 38% of students lived in areas exceeding epa's particle pollution standards, and 70% in areas surpassing the who's standards. [ 85 ] most affected communities were minority populations, leading some residents to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism. [ 86 ] as of 2005, pittsburgh had 31,000 trees along 900 miles of streets. a 2011 analysis valued the annual benefits of the city's urban forest between $10 and $13 million, based on contributions to aesthetics, energy use, and air quality. the city invests $850,000 annually in tree planting and maintenance. [ 87 ] water quality [ edit ] local rivers in pittsburgh continue to exceed epa pollution limits, primarily due to frequently overflowing untreated sewage from the city's outdated infrastructure. [ 88 ] pittsburgh's combined sewer system, built in the early 1900s, carries both stormwater and wastewater, with the treatment plant constructed in 1959. [ 89 ] insufficient upgrades have led to public health concerns, as even a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoff to flow into rivers. [ 90 ] [ 91 ] nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and clean water act violations. [ 92 ] the allegheny county sanitary authority (alcosan) is under a consent decree from the epa and proposed a $2 billion system upgrade in 2017, approved by the epa in 2019. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] [ 95 ] the pittsburgh water and sewer authority (pwsa), responsible for replacing pipes and setting water rates, has faced criticism for alleged mismanagement and for high lead levels in the city's drinking water, particularly in 2016. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] while lead levels have risen for years, many residents blame pwsa's administrative changes for the spike. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] in response, pwsa began adding orthophosphate to the water. [ 102 ] pwsa has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead. [ 102 ] there remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children. [ 103 ] some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and hispanic children in pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.

[ 123 ] demographic changes [ edit ] since the 1940s, city initiatives for redevelopment have driven demographic changes in pittsburgh. in the 1950s, the lower hill district underwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of the civic arena , which opened in 1961. [ 13 ] this project, part of pittsburgh's revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood's population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today. [ 124 ] in the 1960s, the urban redevelopment authority of pittsburgh (ura) aimed to revitalize east liberty , resulting in the construction of penn center mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people. [ 125 ] by the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like home depot, whole foods, and google. this redevelopment, supported by the ura, transformed east liberty into a desirable area for millennials. [ 125 ] these changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government's actions were part of a strategy to disperse black and low-income populations or facilitate gentrification of neighborhoods. [ 124 ] [ 126 ] the demolition of housing units like the east mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like target, is cited as evidence of this process.
