mar 27, 2025 greer cabaret theater 655 penn ave pittsburgh, pa 15222 event website “…a perfectly combustible electric-acoustic outfit whose smart, often challenging and unpredictable compositions draw from fusion, postbop and contemporary jazz.” — jazz times throughout their storied 43-year history, the yellowjackets have recorded 26 albums, received 16 grammy® nominations – won 2 – performed countless sold-out tours, and enjoyed worldwide critical acclaim and commercial success. the yellowjackets formed in the late 1970’s as the backup band for guitarist robben ford. they recorded their first album together in 1980. shortly after that recording, however, ford decided to part ways and go in a different musical direction. as a result, the modern day yellowjackets were formed — a trio with russell ferrante, jimmy haslip and ricky lawson. since then, and with the addition of bob mintzer, the yellowjackets have gained and maintained prominence as one of jazz’s most influential and loved groups. over the years the band has undergone numerous lineup changes. never failing to rise to the inevitable challenges of adjustment, the yellowjackets - russell ferrante, william kennedy, bob mintzer - have maintained an extraordinarily high quality of musicianship that is the rival of many but a surprise to no one who knows and appreciates the band and their music. the most recent addition to the band adds australian bass player dane alderson into the mix. with his exceptional rhythmic sensibility and natural disposition toward groove, dane brings a new energy to the band and adds a youthful approach to the music. the yellowjackets album “raising our voice" was released in fall 2018 and features special guest vocalist luciana souza. their album "jackets xl with the wdr big band" was nominated for a grammy® in 2021. their latest album "parallel motion" (2022) also received a grammy nomination for best jazz instrumental album and is a true testament to the longevity and resilience of a band who debuted over 40 years ago. consistently reinventing themselves through elevated instrumentation in their signature electro-acoustic soundscape, the current lineup showcases a collective at their prime. downtown events view all arts + culture community convention entertainment family festival film & movies holidays market square music nightlife online & virtual events outdoor shopping sports + recreation tours workshops & classes submit an event contact us 412-566-4190 email us pittsburgh downtown partnership the bank tower 307 fourth avenue – floor 2 pittsburgh, pa 15222 share this page facebook twitter linkedin email things to do programs + activities downtown events calendar downtown business directory visit accommodations getting around parking public restrooms construction updates events live housing + residential directory downtown lifestyle residential resources services get involved membership employment opportunities volunteer in downtown become a sponsor vendor, performer & sponsor opportunities development activities meetings do business downtown activity dashboard downtown rent abatement program property opportunities retail + small business resources co-working + shared office developer resources project pop-up paris to pittsburgh development activity about our staff annual meeting + report business improvement district on-street services economic development mobility + transportation research + reports programs + activities publications + social media board of directors connect with us... © 2025  pittsburgh downtown partnership. all rights reserved. | terms of use | privacy policy
