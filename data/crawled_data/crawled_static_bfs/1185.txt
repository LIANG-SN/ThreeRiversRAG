you choose your payments — a fixed annuity each year, a variable amount based upon the value of the trust or other creative options. you choose your beneficiaries — the people you wish to receive ongoing income. you choose your charities such as cmu and other organizations or priorities who will eventually receive the remaining value of the trust. you choose your trustee , which may include a bank or trust company, a trusted individual, yourself or possibly carnegie mellon university, to invest and administer the trust. you enjoy an immediate income tax deduction for a portion of your contribution, and your assets are transferred to the trust, free of capital gains tax. additional information on charitable trusts assets of your trust are not included as part of your estate. establishing this type of trust in your will may help reduce estate taxes. funding a charitable trust with retirement assets may allow your heirs to “stretch” their required payments over their lifetimes rather than the irs-mandated 10-year window for inherited iras. all assets transferred and sold within the trust do not trigger capital gains tax. this is particularly attractive when selling a highly appreciated asset such as a business or a long-term investment. types of charitable trusts annuity: an annuity trust pays you the same dollar amount each year that you choose at the start. your payments remain unchanged for life, regardless of fluctuations in trust investments. unitrust: a unitrust pays you a variable amount yearly based on a percentage of the value of the trust assets. the amount of your payments is recalculated annually. if the value of the trust increases, so do your payments. pooled income fund a pooled income fund offers you variable income today with an opportunity for future growth — making it an attractive retirement planning tool for younger donors wishing to create a future impact. why choose a pooled income fund?
