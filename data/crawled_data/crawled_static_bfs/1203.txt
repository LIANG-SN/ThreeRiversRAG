volunteerism, leadership and involvement in student organizations, athletics or the arts. they are selected each year by their deans and department heads to represent their class in service and leadership. the acs scholars program was launched in 1975 and has recognized almost 1,300 students to date. each scholar receives a monetary award — made possible by the generosity of acs members — to support their academic and personal growth. additionally, the acs scholars participate in an annual giveback event , where as a group they allocate $5,000 back to student-led projects, campus organizations or the campus community. current year scholars - 2025 gabriella howse school of computer science alexandra knox school of computer science elizabeth knox school of computer science gil
