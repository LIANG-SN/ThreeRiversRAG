(so it was an off-day. beauty is in the eye of the long-suffering beholder, ok?) ?it?s been quite a year in pittsburgh, with the steelers winning the super bowl, the penguins winning the stanley cup and our local college football and basketball teams having successful seasons as well,? mayor luke ravenstahl says. ?sports fans in western pennsylvania have had a lot to be proud of these last 12 months. pittsburgh truly is the city of champions once again.? in fact, it may always be sunny in that other city across the state, but citizens there can lay claim to only one title team during the past 12 months. over here?where an elected official changed his name temporarily to ?steelerstahl,? just so, y?know, there was no question of which team he supported when baltimore came to town for an nfl playoff beatdown in january?you?ve got two titles, basketball tournament teams aplenty, and a bowl-bound and backyard brawl-winning football team. oh, and fans like no other. ?we thank them,? super bowl 43 mvp santonio holmes says, ?for being our 12th man.? it?s been a great year, indeed. twelve months like no other city experienced or could expect to experience. unless one of pittsburgh?s adopted sons has his way. ?you?re born into the steeler nation. people get into hockey, and they love the penguins,? says steelers receiver hines ward, who in his 12th season in pittsburgh could count as a naturalized citizen. ?the pirates were great back in the day, and hopefully they can be again. if they can get back on track, they?ll have the whole trifecta?football, hockey and baseball.? and wouldn?t that be a beautiful day. this story appears in the october 12 edition of sporting news magazine. if you are not receiving the magazine, subscribe today , or pick up a copy, available at most barnes & noble, borders and hudson retail outlets. comments share your comment mlb trending topics camden yards at 20: park will feature new statues, lower wall tuesday dec 20 braun's positive test related to 'medical issue' monday dec 19 depleted twins have few free-agent options remaining tuesday dec 20 washington nationals, mike cameron agree on deal monday dec 19 arizona diamondbacks sign of jason kubel monday dec 19 top stories from huff post politi-fail house rejects payroll tax deal watch: egyptian troops, police shoot at protesters in pre-dawn raid gingrich supporter begs him to be 'humble' romney does a 180 on super pacs mlb videos fantasy source baseball see more hot stove report ii reports: angels land pujols, wilson hot stove report reyes to join marlin makeover consistency rating 2.0 free trial subscription to fantasy source aol / sporting news all the great aol and sporting news content in one cool place. go now » sn topic tracker latest nfl mlb nba nhl ncaaf ncaab nascar the latest in-depth coverage and recommended links on sports' biggest stories. syracuse sex abuse scandal bowl game previews: bcs matchups sleepers of the week braun's positive test fantasy football 2011 sleepers of the week 2011 nfl power rankings sn's top 100 players hot stove league braun's positive test dodgers ownership albert pujols' free agency nba lockout nba players overseas 2011 nba hall of fame inductees 2011 nba draft nhl realignment nhl rule changes nhl power rankings ownership update bowl game previews: bcs matchups bowl game previews: non-bcs matchups penn state sex abuse scandal college football recruiting 2012 cincinnati-xavier brawl weekly college basketball polls syracuse sex abuse scandal college basketball recruiting 2012 kobalt tools 500 chase for the nascar sprint cup aaa texas 500 tums fast relief 500 sporting news find on sn search prev hot seatmates a babe shall lead them battle los angeles one man's concussion story first-and-10 stubborn kind of fellow zipadelli on the move absolutely abby yu got your chance, texas better ball in 'big d'?
