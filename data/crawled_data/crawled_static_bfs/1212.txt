endowment is the permanent capital of a university. endowment refers to assets that are invested in perpetuity, unlike expendable funds, which are typically used for immediate needs. while the endowment principal remains in tact, annually a portion of the income is made available to the university. therefore, by building the endowment, carnegie mellon has a greater ability to pay for its operating expenses. a larger endowment provides the university with greater flexibility in launching new projects or initiatives as well as in providing greater support to faculty and students. a common misconception about a university’s endowment is that it is one "pot" of money with which the university can do what it wishes. endowments are comprised of many separate funds, which are managed as a pool of assets. donors set stipulations for funds and for what purpose the income may be spent. if you have further questions, contact us at 412- 268-2582 or annual-giving@andrew.cmu.edu and we'll be happy to discuss the ins and outs of endowment, expendable and other fancy financial terms. give now update your information give now university advancement 5000 forbes ave pittsburgh, pa 15213 contact us legal info www.cmu.edu © 2025 carnegie mellon university cmu on facebook cmu on linkedin cmu youtube channel cmu on instagram alumni attend an event online events and webinar archives in-person events spring carnival homecoming reunion alumni awards get involved volunteer networks regional networks international networks identity networks affinity networks mentorship alumni resources career coaching online alumni community alumni directory alumni email for students alumni in the news class notes about us cmu alumni association board faq give giving opportunities university-wide initiatives college and school initiatives college of engineering college of fine arts dietrich college of humanities and social sciences heinz college of information systems and public policy mellon college of science school of computer science tepper school of business university libraries annual support ways to make your gift online giving credit card (online) check securities & wire transfers donor advised funds crowdfunding estate gifts gifts that provide you income retirement assets life insurance real estate personal property matching gifts cmu employee payroll deduction cryptocurrency gift planning inspiring donor stories create income with giving give through assets design a legacy impact stories donor recognition parents leadership circle order of the may andrew carnegie society the acs board acs legacy scholarships acs scholars program the warner circle the dunfermline circle the highlands circle heinz college dean's circle w. l. mellon society thank a donor student giving contact us faq partner business engagement foundation relations for faculty & staff highlighted foundation partnerships contact us about us leadership news working in university advancement university advancement policies donor bill of rights make possible
