updated: july 1, 2019 at 12:34 am edt ravens running back ray rice became a target of criticism, and an even more unpopular figure as far as the pittsburgh steelers and their fans are concerned, when he wore a terible towel on his head while walking off the field sunday night following a 13-10 victory. steelers linebacker lamarr woodley even chided rice on twitter:  “bad idea ray just ask lendale white and tj whosyourmama,” and, “if youre not a steelers fan, dont put your hands on a terrible towel.” it was a reference from woodley to t.j. houshmandzadeh wiping his shoe with a terrible towel after a touchdown in a win for the cincinnati bengals at heinz field, and titans running back lendale white and linebacker keith bulluck stepping on a terrible towel during a win in pittsburgh. rice said he intended no disrespect by wearing the towel, which he traded his gloves for with a steelers fan. “i actually asked a fan to trade like i’ve been trading jerseys with guys at the end of the game,” rice said. “so, i didn’t stomp it or do anything wrong. i actually walked out with it and i think i’m going to save it and put it in my basement to cherish the rivalry. it’s not like you get out there and do derogatory stuff and spit, no none of that stuff. if you think about it, where i’m at in my career, you cherish these rivalries, cherish the moments. “i apologize to those who saw it as disrespectful. for me, i thought it was a pretty cool gesture, exchanging my gloves with a fan and walking out with it. obviously, getting a victory there was cool and i leave it in the past. their fans are great, the organization is great and the rivalry is always going to continue to be great. to have something in your basement to know what the rivalry is all about is pretty cool i’ve been exchanging jerseys with guys. my basement is geting pretty colorful down there with other teams’ stuff. [having the towel was] not maliciously, just more out of respect.” rice acknowledged that he can see why the steelers were upset. “the other side, they don’t really like it, which i understand why like, ‘nobody plays with the terrible towel,’ and i understand that,” rice said. “i respect this rivalry. i respect their organization. it’s not like you’re going to catch me on youtube burning a terrible towel. i’ll keep it in my basement and when i get to grow up and my time is done you get to look back on these moments: ‘i got to play against the pittsburgh steelers.’ this has actually been the first year i’ve started to collect other teams’ stuff.” awilson@baltsun.com twitter.com/ravensinsider originally published: november 21, 2012 at 4:41 pm est share this: click to share on facebook (opens in new window) click to share on twitter (opens in new window) most popular most popular meet some of the highest-paid nonprofit executives in central maryland meet some of the highest-paid nonprofit executives in central maryland maryland democrats file elections complaint against ‘shadowy’ campaign targeting gov. wes moore maryland democrats file elections complaint against 'shadowy' campaign targeting gov. wes moore royal caribbean to relocate vision of the seas cruises from baltimore to fort lauderdale in 2026 royal caribbean to relocate vision of the seas cruises from baltimore to fort lauderdale in 2026 state house democrats reject gov. wes moore’s funding cuts in blueprint bill state house democrats reject gov. wes moore's funding cuts in blueprint bill maryland farmers left wondering how to pay for solar projects as federal grants remain frozen maryland farmers left wondering how to pay for solar projects as federal grants remain frozen the grill at harryman house to close after nearly 40 years the grill at harryman house to close after nearly 40 years gov. moore’s ‘high bar’ for tax hikes comes crashing down | guest commentary gov. moore's 'high bar' for tax hikes comes crashing down | guest commentary for maryland men’s basketball, big ten tournament bye comes with a warning | takeaways for maryland men's basketball, big ten tournament bye comes with a warning | takeaways a paramedic was the highest-paid baltimore city employee in fiscal year 2024 a paramedic was the highest-paid baltimore city employee in fiscal year 2024 as carroll students’ meal debt tops $14,000, an eldersburg restaurant’s donation makes a dent at century high as carroll students' meal debt tops $14,000, an eldersburg restaurant's donation makes a dent at century high more in sports college sports | inside towson basketball: top-seeded tigers beat drexel in caa tournament quarterfinals baltimore orioles | orioles observations on tomoyuki sugano’s dominance, a small-ball rally and more from doubleheader sports | navy men’s basketball upsets no. 1 seed bucknell, 83-77, in patriot league tournament semifinal baltimore orioles | orioles shutting down grayson rodriguez after cortisone shot in elbow 2012 november 21 jtf publications, llc capital gazette studio 1847 company info about us contact mary j. corey internships photo reprints archives privacy policy en espanol tag disclosures sitemap advertising classified public notices the sun store subscribe now subscriber terms and conditions terms of service cookie policy cookie preferences california notice at collection ca notice of financial incentive do not sell/share my personal information copyright © 2025 baltimore sun close
