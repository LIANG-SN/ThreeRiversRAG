adults enjoy their opera experience. audio commentary service pittsburgh opera offers an audio commentary service for patrons with visual impairments during the tuesday* performances at all our productions (unless other date is specified). through assistive listening devices, patrons can hear the supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as hear descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes. a patron may reserve a seat in advance by calling 412-281-0912, extension 213. an all-volunteer team has provided the audio commentary service since 2003. several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up assistive listening devices. an audio describer reads from the program book ten minutes before the performance—the "pre-show"—and then reads the supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage during the performance—the "play-by-play". we're thankful to our volunteers who provide this service each season! pittsburgh opera audio commentary team— julia, ray, jan, donna, and mary ann braille and large-print programs braille and large-print programs are available at each performance. hearing assistance infrared hearing devices are available at our benedum center performances. channel 1 on the infrared hearing devices is for audio amplification. sign language interpretation sign language interpretation can usually be arranged upon request. please see our accessibility webpage for details. opera study guides the study guides for each opera are posted in pdf format on the pittsburgh opera website in advance of the opera's opening, and are available in paper form at all performances, in the lobby area. for more information about pittsburgh opera programs for adults, please
