when (things past) , 1948, collection of the madison museum of contemporary art, wisconsin, gift of the gertrude abercrombie trust gertrude abercrombie (american, 1909–1977) was a critical figure in the mid-20th-century chicago art scene and a creative force who, from the 1930s until her death in 1977, produced enigmatic paintings populated with objects and figures of personal significance. with a deft hand, a concise symbolic vocabulary, and a restrained palette, she created potent images that speak to her mercurial nature and her evolving psychology as an artist. cats, owls, snails, doors, moons, barren trees, seashells, forking paths, and masked figures all converge in her mysterious works, which suggest a life of wistful introspection and emotional struggle. drawing consistently on her own dreams as source material, abercrombie said, “the whole world is a mystery.” this exhibition presents a rare opportunity for museum visitors to appreciate—in significant depth—abercrombie’s highly personal language that draws on surrealist and magic realism approaches to probe deeply into the nature of things. featuring loans from important institutional and private collections, gertrude

artist gertrude abercrombie was born in 1909 in austin, texas. she grew up in the hyde park neighborhood of chicago but also spent significant time in her father’s hometown of aledo, illinois, which would later become a source of inspiration for her paintings. she earned a degree in romance languages at the university of illinois, urbana-champaign, in 1929, after which she pursued a year-long course in commercial art at the american academy of art and may also have briefly attended the school of the art institute of chicago. in 1932, abercrombie began her career as a professional artist, an ambition that was forwarded when she gained employment on the federal art project of the works progress administration (wpa/fap) from 1935–1940. she showed her work widely, including in the art institute of chicago’s annual exhibitions and at avant-garde venues like the katharine kuh gallery. by the late 1930s, abercrombie had developed her mature style, creating tightly executed paintings populated by personal symbols that pulse with mystery and which have been identified with surrealism, magic realism, and the fantastic. she worked in this vein for the remainder of her career, but her output gradually decreased toward the end of her life due to ongoing health struggles. abercrombie was also well known as the host of parties and jam sessions, which were attended by her artist, writer, and jazz musician friends. abercrombie with there on the table (1935), gertrude abercrombie paper, circa 1880-1986, bulk 1935-1977, archives of american art, smithsonian institution selected
