only new rankings (2007) are summarized here. there were no new rankings in the other natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, fine arts, library and information studies or public affairs areas. u.s. news methodology according to u.s. news, rankings are based on two types of data: expert opinion about program quality and statistical indicators that measure the quality of a schools faculty, research and students. these data come from surveys of more than 1,200 programs and some 12,500 academics and professionals that were conducted in fall 2006, u.s. news stated. to gather the opinion data, the magazine asked deans, program directors and senior faculty to judge the academic quality of programs in their field on a scale of 1 (marginal) to 5 (outstanding). in the five disciplines, the magazine also surveyed professionals in the field who are directly involved in the hiring process. the statistical indicators used in our rankings of business, education, engineering, law and medical schools fall into two categories: inputs, or measures of the qualities that students and faculty bring to the educational experience; and outputs, measures of graduates achievements linked to their degrees, the magazine stated. depending on the field, output measures vary, u.s. news stated. for example, indicators in the business discipline include starting salaries after graduation and the time it takes graduates to find jobs. for law, indicators include state bar exam passing rates and how long it takes new attorneys to land jobs. the weights applied to the indicators reflect the magazines judgment about their relative importance, as determined in consultation with experts in each field.every schools performance is presented relative to the other schools with which it is being compared. tied schools are listed alphabetically. business the joseph m. katz graduate school of business was ranked no. 51 (48th last year) out of 66 business schools listed in the expanded online edition. according to u.s. news, all 407 masters programs accredited by the association to advance collegiate schools of business were surveyed. of these, 113 provided the data needed to calculate rankings using the magazines methodology. quality indicators for business schools included overall academic quality assessment as determined by deans and directors of accredited mba programs, as well as by corporate recruiters and company contacts who hired mba graduates from previously ranked programs;
