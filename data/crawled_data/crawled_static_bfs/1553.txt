[ 1 ] history [ edit ] prior to 1998, the jcc of greater pittsburgh had a small community gallery for nearly 25 years.  under the auspices of leslie a. golomb archived 2010-05-14 at the wayback machine , the gallery underwent a period of substantial growth, evolving into a museum and receiving accreditation from the council of american jewish museums (cajm). [ 2 ] accreditation by cajm requires strict adherence to standards regarding archives, catalogues, and curating, as well as educational programs and outreach. today, the ajm galleries are still located on the pittsburgh jcc's squirrel hill campus.  while the ajm continues to emphasize the pittsburgh community in its exhibitions and programming, its scope has grown as it collaborates with regional, national, and international artists and organizations.  additionally, the ajm frequently explores jewish themes such as contemporary iterations of rituals, but aims to reach the wider community though exhibits with broad appeal and programming that encourages interfaith discourse. recent exhibitions [ edit ] as a non-collecting museum, the ajm works with local, national, and international artists to create original exhibitions, [ 3 ] and occasionally hosts traveling exhibitions from institutions such as the united states holocaust memorial museum .
