in the past, collectors believed that a replica of a masterpiece was superior to a mediocre original. this fascination with plaster casts dates back to ancient greece and rome and continued through the renaissance into the 19th century. plaster casts were particularly popular during this time as they were featured in international fairs and served as educational tools for both amateurs and art students. our collection was made possible by the vision of andrew carnegie, who by 1907 had amassed a collection of 144 architectural casts, 69 plaster reproductions of sculpture, and 360 replicas in bronze, including beloved favorites from classical antiquity, such as the apollo belvedere and the venus de milo, as well as gothic masterpieces like the florence baptistry doors, and even a full reproduction of the facade of st.-gilles-du-gard. nowadays, plaster casts are not as popular as they once were, and most collections have been dispersed or destroyed. we invite you to come experience this distinguished part of our collection for yourself, and step back in time to encounter the beauty of these architectural masterpieces! art around you hall of architecture hall of sculpture grand staircase sculpture court fountain plaza scaife lobby gallery of miniatures home of the carnegie trees ‚è∏ carnegie trees for over six decades, the annual installation and decoration of the soaring evergreens in the hall of architecture, fondly known as the carnegie trees, has been the signature tradition of the women‚Äôs committee of carnegie museum of art. home of the carnegie trees ‚è∏ carnegie trees for over six decades, the annual installation and decoration of the soaring evergreens in the hall of architecture, fondly known as the carnegie trees, has been the signature tradition of the women‚Äôs committee of carnegie museum of art. art around you hall of architecture hall of sculpture grand staircase sculpture court fountain plaza scaife lobby gallery of miniatures 4400 forbes avenue pittsburgh, pa 15213 +1 412.622.3131 contact us access and accommodations health and safety careers event rentals image licensing instagram facebook twitter linkedin youtube search üîç art in your inbox üìß carnegie museum of art terms of use , privacy policy , non-discrimination policy ¬© carnegie museum of art, carnegie institute. all rights reserved. one of the four carnegie museums .
