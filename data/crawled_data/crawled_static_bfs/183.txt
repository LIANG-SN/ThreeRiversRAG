fort pitt museum - history and story a        history of the point overview: few          places in america can rival the point, a small area at the forks of the          ohio river, for historical significance. the long contest (1755-1763)          between france and great britain that started here would develop into          an epic struggle between the two imperial powers--what many regard as          the first truly world war. on the fate of the point would hinge          that of half of the north american continent, as well as the destiny of          the republic that would come into existence in 1776. during the          mid-1700s, the french and the british erected fortifications that protected          their claims to the early west and served as bases for their trade with          the native americans. even after the departure of the french in 1758,          the area retained significant strategic value as americans, the british,          and native americans wrestled for ultimate control. meanwhile, the city          of pittsburgh took root and flourished, growing into a major industrial          and commercial center that engulfed the point. redevelopment of the area          during the mid-20th century included creation of a new state park that          enables visitors to experience what the point was like during its early          years. the fort          pitt museum is located in a re-created 18th century bastion of the fort          that great britain built in 1759, after it captured the point from the          french; the outline of the french fort duquesne, built in 1754, is nearby.          the museum's exhibits focus on the struggle that exploded into the french          and indian war (sometimes referred to as the seven year war or the war          for empire) but also addresses such topics as the american revolution,          the whiskey rebellion of 1794, and the founding of the city of pittsburgh. a          contest for control: for the french, the ohio river and other waterways represented the best          way to connect their well-established colonies in new france (in present-day          canada) and the great lakes to their many outposts, which extended as          far south as louisiana. conversely, by expanding their settlements and          trade activities beyond the allegheny mountains into the fertile ohio          river valley, the british would be asserting their own control of this          area while blocking french expansion. by the mid-1700s,          the two powers recognized that the forks of the ohio--where the french          line of communication was most vulnerable--was the major strategic prize          in this epic struggle and resolved to challenge one another for its control          by building a fortification there. france and great britain would risk          many lives and spend enormous sums to control this piece of land. caught          between two of europe's most powerful nations, native americans in the          region strove to preserve their culture and lands. the contest          began in late 1753, when the governor of virginia dispatched a young militia          officer to the french outposts in what is now southwestern pennsylvania          in order to warn them that they were encroaching on land that virginia          claimed as its own. this young officer, george washington, observed firsthand          the importance of the forks of the ohio and recommended that virginia          put a fortification there. the governor concurred and sent a small detachment          of soldiers to build a fort, to be named fort prince george, on the point.          as the soldiers were constructing this fort, in april 1754, a force of          500 french troops and native americans overwhelmed them without firing          a shot and subsequently began constructing fort duquesne in its place.          on may 28, 1754, reinforcements from virginia led by washington clashed          with a group of french soldiers 50 miles south of the point in what became          known as the jumonville affair. in retaliation, 900 french and indian          soldiers attacked fort necessity, which washington had hurriedly built,          and forced him to surrender late on the night of july 3, 1754. the british          government, having decided that the point must be taken, in 1755 sent          general edward braddock and 1,500 regular troops to accomplish this task.          braddock built a road out of virginia, across maryland, and into southern          pennsylvania, but he was surprised and defeated by the smaller force of          french and native americans at turtle creek on july 9, 1755, in what is          known as the battle of the monongahela. two-thirds of those in braddock's          force were killed or wounded in devastating defeat. the battle's aftermath          was a wave of attacks by native americans all along the colonial frontier          and, in time, conflict between france and england around the world: the          final colonial war between the two powers, which would extend until 1763,          had begun in southwestern pennsylvania. it was not          until three years later, on november 25, 1758, that another army--6,000          british and colonial soldiers led by general john forbes--reclaimed the          point for the british empire. forbes's army, having cut another road across          most of pennsylvania in order to reach the point, arrived to find it in          ruins; the french, again outnumbered and now poorly supplied, had abandoned          fort duquesne to the british. subsequent defeats of the french elsewhere,          culminating in the capture of quebec in september 1759, brought an end          to france's long-lived empire in north america. the          beginnings of pittsburgh: once general forbes secured the point for great britain, he commissioned          a temporary fort (sometimes called fort mercer, after its commander) to          replace the one the french had left in ashes and ordered that a new, permanent          fortification be built of earth, stone, timber, and brick on a site just          east of the ruins of fort duquesne. forbes named the area "pittsbourgh"          in honor of william pitt, the british prime minister who had led the successful          war against france. almost immediately          the official name of pittsbourgh evolved into "pittsburgh" and          the fort itself gradually became known as "fort pitt". one of          the largest british strongholds in north america (17 1/2 acres in all,          2 1/2 acres within the walls), it became the center of british military          and trading activities west of the allegheny mountains. though it was          never attacked by the french, fort pitt (along with nearby fort ligonier          and a handful of smaller outposts) was among the few british forts that          successfully withstood a native american siege during the conflict known          as pontiac's war. during the siege, which lasted from may 27 to august          9, 1763, hundreds of people took refuge inside fort pitt. only when colonel          henry bouquet led british troops to a victory over native american forces          in the battle of bushy run was the siege lifted. fort          pitt and the american revolution: with the french threat gone, great britain could reduce its military presence          on the frontier and evacuate fort pitt, which was proving difficult and          expensive to maintain. in october of 1772 they sold the fort and its buildings          to william thompson and alexander ross for Â£50 new york currency.          which civil authority would now govern the area was unclear, though, for          pennsylvania and virginia both believed that is today the southwest corner          of pennsylvania fell within their territory. in 1774, virginia began to          enforce its claim to be the region "west of laurel hill": john          connolly took over the fort, rebuilt it, and named it fort dunmore after          the governor of virginia, lord dunmore. (this name did not catch on.)          supporters of virginia and those of pennsylvania clashed repeatedly through          may of 1775. when word          of the battles at lexington and concord reached pittsburgh that month,          the virginia and pennsylvania factions were able to work together to support          the american revolution. conferences with native americans, held at fort          pitt, achieved a tenuous neutrality between the new continental government          and the native american nations in the region. fort pitt was maintained          by virginia's revolutionary government until 1777, when an increase in          attacks by native americans allied with the british and american loyalists          prompted the continental congress to appoint general edward hand to take          control of fort pitt, which under hand and his successors served as the          western district headquarters of the continental army. troops and          supplies were gathered at fort pitt for the defense of the new nation's          western frontier, and a series of military campaigns would venture west          from the fort at the forks of the ohio. in addition, negotiations with          native american nations in the region continued to be held at fort pitt.          the first peace treaty the united states ever signed with native americans          was negotiated and signed at fort pitt on september 17, 1778. fort          pitt's final years: when the american revolution ended, fort pitt and west point were the          only military fortifications that the united states army maintained. fort          pitt would continue as a supply depot and base of operations until 1792,          when its condition had deteriorated so much that a new fort, called fort          fayette, was built to replace it. (this fort was located near ninth street          and penn avenue in pittsburgh). the old fort was finally dismantled and          salvaged, its remnants used by pittsburghers in their construction of          more permanent housing for themselves. soon the site of fort pitt was          being used for other purposes. the          emergence of pittsburgh: for years, the settlements that grew up around fort pitt had been little          more than a garrison town servicing the fort. by the 1790s, however, pittsburgh          began to develop on its own. with expansion westward beginning to boom,          and much of the migration westward passing through pittsburgh and down          the ohio river, the town was ideally located to serve as the "gateway          to the west". here travelers stocked up before heading further west.          here, too, products from the east and the west were exchanged. pittsburgh's          unparalleled strategic location was key to its success in another way:          besides being well situated physically it was surrounded by valuable natural          resources vital to industrial development. pittsburgh's industry and commerce          blossomed throughout the 19th century. gristmills, printing shops, manufacturing          establishments, shipbuilders, glassworks (pittsburgh made most of america's          glass during this time), and the iron industry took root and grew vigorously          in the pittsburgh area. with its heavy river traffic and diverse commerce          and industry, pittsburgh truly was "the workshop of the world".          at its peak, pittsburgh produced more than one quarter of all the steel          made in the entire world. by the mid-20th          century, pittsburgh took stock of itself. the first priority was to clean          up its air and then its physical appearance, undertaking a bold urban          redevelopment that gained world attention. part of that immense project          involved replacing the substandard housing and industrial buildings of          the historic point with a scenic area, point state park. the city also          built new strengths in such areas as robotics, computer science, and medicine.          as a result of all these steps, pittsburgh gained attention as an example          of a "renaissance city"--but one that still values its past,          a past that began here at the point. the          fort pitt museum this structure,          dedicated in 1969 and subsequently enlarged, is a site of the pennsylvania          historical and museum commission. housed in the recreated monongahela          bastion, its exterior construction shows visitors how fort pitt used earthworks          and masonry facing for its defense. inside, 27,000 square feet containing          dioramas and exhibits depicting the region's history from the early french          expeditions to the beginning of pittsburgh's industrial age before 1800. a visit          begins in william pitt memorial hall, whose 16-foot wide well houses a          scale model of fort pitt and the point as they looked in 1765; a recorded          narration highlights key features of both. also on the first floor are          replicas of a fur trader's cabin, a barracks room, and an artillery casemate--all          reminders of what life at this colonial outpost was like. upstairs,          a newly installed exhibit portrays the causes, events, and consequences          of the long contest between france and great britain, with special emphasis          on the role that the point and fort pitt itself played. many original          documents and artifacts are displayed. visitors should allow one to three          hours, depending on individual interest, to see the entire museum, which          also houses the bastion gift shop. the          blockhouse the small structure popularly known as "the blockhouse" (in          actuality a strong defensive structure outside fort pitt itself that provided          covering fire in any attack) is not only the last surviving building of          the original fort and pittsburgh's earliest building, but the oldest authenticated          structure west of the allegheny mountains. dating to 1764, it was used          for many other purposes during its long history. today, the restored blockhouse,          which is administered by the daughters of the american revolution (dar),          serves as a final link to the 18 acres that formed the first site of the          city of pittsburgh. there is no admission charge to the blockhouse.
