you know they're smart,” kalaris said. plumber patrick watt, 28, who works in the city, said he was a little surprised by the new survey, but he'll let it stand, so long as no one tries to take away pittsburgh's “city of champions” honors for steelers' super bowl wins, pirates' world series pennants and penguins' stanley cup trophies. joseph latimer, 31, of the north side grinned when he heard the news. “i don't know what those other cities are made of, but there's some pretty smart people around here,” latimer said, as he paused on a walk with his daughter, alayna, 6. debra erdley is a staff writer for trib total media. she can be reached at 412-320-7996 or derdley@tribweb.com . email newsletters triblive's daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox. 1-800-909-8742 fax (724) 779-8743 210 wood street tarentum, pa 15084 © 2025 trib total media | all rights reserved about us about us advertise career opportunities contact advertising contact newsroom contact us feedback request correction resource center scholarship opportunities send letter to the editor send news tip subscribe subscriber services get the trib blog efeatures email newsletters etrib facebook home delivery instagram linkedin marketing minute store locations triblive app - app store triblive app - google play twitter sections arts & entertainment best of the best business directory circulars contests coronavirus lifestyles local news obituaries opinion our publications photos real estate sports video weather terms of use cookie settings privacy policy terms of service top
