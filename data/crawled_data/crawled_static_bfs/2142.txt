"no estamos haciendo las cosas básicas y fundamentales de buena manera, estamos perdiendo mucho el balón y no estamos forzando intercambios a nuestro favor. no estamos generando jugadas de alto impacto y no puedes ganar un juego contra un rival de ese calibre anotando 10 puntos" comentó coach tomlin ante los medios de comunicación tras el partido. los steelers fueron doblegados por el brazo de mahomes, quién lanzó para 320 yardas y tres pases de anotación. la línea ofensiva de los chiefs lució muy fuerte y no permitieron capturas. del otro lado la historia fue diferente, la línea ofensiva de los steelers sufrió para poder proteger a russell wilson, quien sufrió cinco capturas en el partido. el juego arrancó bravo, los chiefs anotaron en sus primeras dos series ofensivas y fallaron un punto extra, la diferencia era de 13 puntos, la ofensiva movió bien el balón pero cuando llegó a zona roja, russell wilson lanzó una intercepción que impactó en el marcador. ya en el segundo cuarto wilson anotó el único touchdown del equipo con una carrera de una yarda. el juego terrestre ahora no fue factor najee harris y jaylen warren tuvieron más de 70 yardas por tierra y russell wilson 55 yardas pero eso no fue suficiente para marcar diferencia a la ofensiva, los 10 puntos de este miércoles contra los chiefs es la menor cantidad de puntos de la ofensiva desde la semana 13 del 2023 contra arizona. hay que darle vuelta a la hoja y pensar en el cierre de campaña en contra de los bengals y en llegar con un mejor ritmo y con los errores corregidos de camino a los playoffs en el mes de enero. feliz navidad here we go! game photos: week 17 vs chiefs game action photos from the steelers' week 17 game against the kansas city chiefs at acrisure stadium 1 / 69 pittsburgh steelers head coach mike tomlin during a regular season game between the pittsburgh steelers and the kansas city chiefs, wednesday, dec. 25, 2024 in pittsburgh, pa.
