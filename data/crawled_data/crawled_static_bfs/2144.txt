"no hicimos lo necesario para obtener la victoria. felicito a los ravens por su desempeño y su victoria. no controlamos el juego terrestre, nunca lo hicimos y cuando no puedes hacer eso tienes que ganar el juego con cambios de posesión y jugadas de alto impacto, pero eso tampoco lo pudimos lograr" el no poder controlar el juego terrestre de los ravens fue clave, derrick henry corrió para 162 yardas durante el partido y eso ayudó a baltimore a controlar el partido y a desgastar a la defensiva de los steelers. la primera mitad fue una muy de estilo de estos partidos divisionales, ríspida, competida y muy pareja, los ravens se fueron arriba 17-10. la defensiva y los equipos especiales ya habían dado señales buenas provocando dos balones sueltos durante los dos primeros cuartos, pero en ninguna de las ocasiones lograron recuperar el ovoide. en los últimos cinco minutos del tercer cuarto russell wilson conectó con cordarrelle patterson, quién en tres tiempos se llevó el pase de anotación con el que el juego se empataría a 17. después de eso los ravens respondieron con siete puntos más. con el marcador 24 - 17 a favor de los locales, minkah fitzpatrick interceptó un pase a lamar jackson que reavivó las esperanzas de los steelers de empatar el partido en el último cuarto pero todo eso se derrumbó dos jugadas después del intercambio de balón cuando russell wilson fue presionado, lanzó un mal pase y marlon humphrey completó el pick six que separó todavía más el marcador 31-17. una tarde complicada para la línea ofensiva de pittsburgh que permitió 3 capturas y varias jugadas forzadas por parte de wilson debido a la presión ejercida por la defensiva. justin tucker marcó la diferencia definitiva con un gol de campo que dejó el marcador 34-17 a favor de los ravens. habrá que sacudirse esta derrota y dar la vuelta de inmediato porque el próximo 25 de diciembre, en plena navidad, los steelers enfrentarán a los chiefs en un juego que puede definir el orden de los playoffs en la conferencia americana. hablaremos de ese partido más tarde en la semana. con la mente en los kansas city chiefs. here we go! game photos: week 16 at ravens game action photos from the steelers' week 16 game against the baltimore ravens at m&t bank stadium 1 / 92 pittsburgh steelers defensive tackle keeanu benton (95) during a regular season game between the pittsburgh steelers and the baltimore ravens, saturday, dec. 21, 2024 in baltimore, md.
