(karl roser / pittsburgh steelers) model: nikon z 9 lens (mm): 85 iso: 1600 aperture: 1.4 shutter: 1/250 karl roser/pittsburgh steelers 3 / 10 pittsburgh steelers tight end pat freiermuth (88) makes a one-handed catch during a regular season game between the pittsburgh steelers and the new york jets, sunday, oct. 20, 2024 in pittsburgh, pa. the steelers defeated the jets 37-15. you can see freiermuth's eye looking right at the ball as he pulls it in with only one hand. this was just the right moment in the right position.

(karl roser / pittsburgh steelers) model: nikon z 9 lens (mm): 14 iso: 2000 aperture: 2.8 shutter: 1/1250 karl roser/pittsburgh steelers 5 / 10 pittsburgh steelers quarterback russell wilson (3) warms up on the sideline prior to a regular season game between the pittsburgh steelers and the cleveland browns, thursday, nov. 21, 2024 in cleveland, oh. the browns defeated the steelers 24-19. during the browns introductions the stadium lights are turned off. this creates some great opportunities for dramatic lighting. it just happened that the spotlight for the browns players spilled over and onto russell wilson's face as he was warming up. i was looking and waiting for this moment to present itself. (karl roser / pittsburgh steelers) model: nikon z 9 lens (mm): 200 iso: 16000 aperture: 2.8 shutter: 1/500 karl roser/pittsburgh steelers 6 / 10 pittsburgh steelers cornerback beanie bishop jr. (31) intercepts a pass during a regular season game between the pittsburgh steelers and the new york jets, sunday, oct. 20, 2024 in pittsburgh, pa. the steelers defeated the jets 37-15. i enjoy the story telling of this action photo. as bishop is running with the ball, porter holds his finger up in celebration while on top of the intended receiver. you can even see the blue flag in the top left of the frame thrown by the referee indicating that there has been a turnover of possession. (karl roser / pittsburgh steelers) model: nikon z 9 lens (mm): 400 iso: 2500 aperture: 2.8 shutter: 1/1600 karl roser/pittsburgh steelers 7 / 10 pittsburgh steelers head coach mike tomlin watches his players from the sideline through heavy snow fall during a regular season game between the pittsburgh steelers and the cleveland browns, thursday, nov. 21, 2024 in cleveland, oh. the browns defeated the steelers 24-19. when it snows as heavily as it did during this game, it is hard to see what is happening with your own eye, let alone looking through a view finder of your camera. i was moving as close to coach tomlin as i could to ensure i would hit my focus and isolate him against the clean background of falling snow. i love that the snow has built up on his beard and hat and that hopefully helps to tell part of the story from that day.

(karl roser / pittsburgh steelers) model: nikon z 9 lens (mm): 400 iso: 2000 aperture: 2.8 shutter: 1/1250 karl roser/pittsburgh steelers 10 / 10 pittsburgh steelers wide receiver george pickens (14) catches a pass for a touchdown during a regular season game between the pittsburgh steelers and the washington commanders, sunday, nov. 10, 2024 in landover, md. the steelers defeated the commanders 28-27. as i watched the play unfold through the viewfinder of my 400mm, i quickly switched to my 70-200mm mid throw, to photograph pickens' incredible reception right in front of me.
