(alysa rubin / pittsburgh steelers) model: nikon z9 lens (mm): 24 iso 3200 aperture: 5.6 shutter: 1/250 alysa rubin/pittsburgh steelers 4 / 10 pittsburgh steelers defensive tackle larry ogunjobi (99) taps the "men of steel" sign outside of the steelers locker room prior to a regular season game against the cincinnati bengals, saturday, jan. 4, 2025 in pittsburgh, pa. the bengals beat the steelers 19-17. i had the idea for this image after i noticed some of our players tapping the "men of steel" sign that hangs outside of the locker room before heading out to the field. it's an introspective moment that speaks to tradition and the history of our team. to create this image, i rigged a remote camera above the sign, triggering it to fire as ogunjobi reached out to touch the sign. (alysa rubin / pittsburgh steelers) model:nikon d6 lens (mm): 50 iso 3200 aperture: 5 shutter: 1/800 alysa rubin/pittsburgh steelers 5 / 10 pittsburgh steelers wide receiver mike williams (18) catches a pass for a touchdown during a regular season game against the washington commanders, sunday, nov. 10, 2024 in landover, md. the steelers defeated the commanders 28-27. when i saw russell wilson wind up to throw deep towards the end of the game, i quickly switched from my 400mm lens to my 70-200mm to capture williams' first touchdown as a steeler.

(alysa rubin / pittsburgh steelers) model: nikon z9 lens (mm): 18 iso 100 aperture: 2.8 shutter: 1/1250 alysa rubin/pittsburgh steelers 7 / 10 pittsburgh steelers linebacker nick herbig (51) strip sacks cincinnati bengals quarterback joe burrow (9) during a regular season game, sunday, dec. 1, 2024 in cincinnati, oh. the steelers defeated the bengals 44-38. i was focused on cincinnati bengals quarterback joe burrow when i saw nick herbig beat a lineman and break for burrow. herbig swatted the ball out of burrow's hand, allowing payton wilson to scoop the ball up and return it for a touchdown.

(31) puts on his helmet prior to a regular season game between the pittsburgh steelers and the indianapolis colts, sunday, sept. 29, 2024 in indianapolis, in. the colts beat the steelers 27-24. on a game day, i often seek out quiet moments before the action on the field begins. using a 85mm lens with an aperture of 1.4, i framed bishop's face through his helmet as he was pulling it on. (alysa rubin / pittsburgh steelers) model: nikon z9 lens (mm): 85 iso 1000 aperture: 1.4 shutter: 1/2000 alysa rubin/pittsburgh steelers 9 / 10 the pittsburgh steelers special teams celebrates after recovering a fumble during a regular season game against the washington commanders, sunday, nov. 10, 2024 in landover, md. the steelers defeated the commanders 28-27. after the washington commanders kick returner muffed a punt and ben skowronek recovered the fumble right in front of me, i chose to sprint for the end zone, knowing that the team would run down to celebrate. i positioned myself below the tv camera, using a 24-70mm lens to make sure i was capturing the entire group. the moment was a blur, and i might have gotten yelled at afterwards by a security guard for accidentally sitting in front of the play clock. my bad! (alysa rubin / pittsburgh steelers) model: nikon z9 lens (mm): 29 iso 250 aperture: 2.8 shutter: 1/2000 alysa rubin/pittsburgh steelers 10 / 10 pittsburgh steelers defensive tackle cameron heyward (97) prepares to take the field prior to a regular season game between the pittsburgh steelers and the new york giants, monday, oct. 28, 2024 in pittsburgh, pa. the steelers defeated the giants 26-18. as heyward runs out of the tunnel to take the field, he yells "let's go!" and gets really hyped during team introductions. it's a moment that only the fans looking over the railing into the tunnel can see. i wanted to capture the intensity and the passion that he shows in this moment. i also love that the team wore the color rush uniforms for this game, which matched the yellow strobe lights of the tunnel perfectly.
