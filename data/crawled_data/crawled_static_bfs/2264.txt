website will continue to be assessed on a recurring basis from both an engineering and user-experience basis (including the use of assistive technology (such as screen readers and screen magnifiers), and the involvement of users with disabilities who use such assistive technologies) in order to provide prioritized feedback to the club regarding substantial conformance with the wcag. contact the
