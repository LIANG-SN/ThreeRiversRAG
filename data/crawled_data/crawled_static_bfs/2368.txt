1980: arnold weber weber served as provost for the college of humanities and social sciences (now dietrich college), the school of urban and public affairs (now heinz college) and the graduate school of industrial administration (now the tepper school of business). he was also dean of the business school but resigned from the position in 1977 to concentrate on the provost's role. he left carnegie mellon in 1980 to become president at northwestern university. 1964 - 1981: edward schatz from 1964 through 1973, carnegie mellon did not have a university provost, per se. instead, president warner created the position of vice president for academic affairs and chose edward schatz to fill that position. as vice president for academic affairs, schatz led and coordinated the development and improvement of the university's total education program. he played key roles in the merger with the mellon institute of research and in creating the school of urban and public affairs (now heinz college). the university changed dramatically during schatz' tenure. the college of engineering was divided into the carnegie institute of technology and the mellon college of science. margaret morrison carnegie college was phased out over the course of several years, and the college of humanities and social sciences (now dietrich college) was created with departments in english, history, modern languages and psychology. wean hall and warner hall were constructed, and the student body continued to expand. faculty members formed the faculty senate in 1968 to address major campus issues. in 1973, president cyert officially reinstituted the office of the provost but split the office between two individuals, schatz and arnold weber. under cyert, schatz oversaw all educational matters in the carnegie institute of technology (now college of engineering) and the college of fine arts. schatz served as interim university president for a short time in 1972 before cyert took office. while schatz was provost, the university continued to grow. the robotics institute opened and carnegie mellon celebrated its first nobel laureate, herb simon, who won the nobel prize in economics in 1978. schatz was instrumental in bringing the first computers to carnegie mellon and encouraged the growth of technology on campus. after serving as provost, schatz became senior vice president of the university and oversaw large building projects, like the $47 million university center.
