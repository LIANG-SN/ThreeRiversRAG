property damage or that presents a threat to the health or safety of the community by means of disease transmission or direct attacks. the bureau also quarantines animals, provides removal of deceased animals, and assists police and the district attorney's office with humane investigations. although animal care & control encourages responsible pet/companion ownership there are still over 1,300 dogs and cats picked up yearly. many are reunited with their homes through a partnership the city has with a local animal shelter. due to the wooded mountainous geography of our city, residents share
