helping your neighbors is snow much fun! snow-covered sidewalks can be hazardous for everyone. the city of pittsburgh’s snow angels program pairs older residents and residents with disabilities with nearby neighbors who volunteer to assist them with snow removal on their sidewalks and walkways. along with fostering stronger community relationships and relieving some of the stress that comes from a snowfall or freeze, snow angels make our sidewalks safer for those who are outside during the winter weather, like postal carriers, firefighters, police officers, and other neighbors. in 2023, we encouraged coaches, faith-based and community leaders to sign up their groups as snow angels to support their neighbors in need. requirements for snow angel recipients if you’d like a neighbor to come
