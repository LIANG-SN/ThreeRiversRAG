"bars tend to be concentrated in rust belt cities or in cities with large breweries such as milwaukee or st. louis," said jeff khadavi, president of infogroup data licensing. "cities with large numbers of bars also have a high concentration of pizza restaurants, which is our theory on how pittsburgh was the top of the list for bars per capita and second for pizza restaurants per capita." mineo's pizza house recently upped that number by adding a bar to its squirrel hill restaurant. "there's really not a bar in this span of murray avenue, so we figured it would be a home run," said giovanni mineo, vice president. the restaurant began selling beer in 2011. "we have a lot of college students in this area from carnegie mellon, pitt and carlow," mr. mineo said. "they have to eat." murray avenue alone has no less than four places to grab a slice, with lucci's pizza and napoli pizzeria a few blocks away. sharing the same block with mineo's is aiello's pizza, the other half of the famous rivalry that has pitted aiello's devotees against mineo's fans for decades. aiello's has been promoting a full selection of beers on its website. "there's a communal nature to the neighborhoods of this city," said kevin joyce, owner of the carlton, downtown and past president of the pennsylvania restaurant association. "we like to congregate, to have a beer with our neighbor, to watch a sporting event with others, to share a pizza with family and friends at the local pizzeria or pub." and, of course, pizza and a drink can be an inexpensive treat. "we're not no. 1 for fine dining restaurants or wine consumption, but we do gather and spend at the neighborhood bar and restaurant," mr. joyce said. he offered a few points to keep in mind about such studies. "my gut is that we are skewed because the geographic area of the 'city' of pittsburgh is very small," mr. joyce said. "a couple of miles from downtown in any direction and you're out of pittsburgh. so the concentration of pizza spots in pittsburgh neighborhoods and entertainment spots — think south side or the strip (district) — make our numbers look more impressive than perhaps they really are." r.j. o'hara of flaherty & o'hara p.c., a downtown law firm that specializes in liquor licenses, also noted the city's population has declined steadily over the last several decades, likely sending that ratio higher. another factor is pennsylvania's unique take on its liquor license system. "liquor licenses have a value associated with them, and they're treated like an asset so it makes sense for someone to hold on to them. they're lienable," mr. o'hara said. "it's not like that in other states." jim mitchell, whose family created mitchell's restaurant, bar and banquet center, downtown more than 100 years ago, said he's surprised the bar-to-person ratio is so high given allegheny county's drink tax and the statewide smoking ban, as well as the overall tough economy. "i've seen a lot of places go out of business," mr. mitchell said. "there aren't too many independents left, especially running bars and restaurants downtown." at mitchell's, about 70 percent of the business comes from the restaurant, but the bar is a staple. "at the bar, if you give them a good product at the right price and don't water down your beers, you've got good business," mr. mitchell said. over time, tastes have changed. "we're carrying more microbrews now. people are going more top shelf in their choice of liquor, too," mr. mitchell said. "when i was a kid, we only had a few beers. it's not the shot-and-a-beer days as much. "i'd say three-to-one people are choosing top shelf bottles like stoli or absolut (vodka) over what we call well liquor," he said. in 2013, about 2,822 breweries were in operation in the u.s., the highest total since the 1870s, according to the brewers association, a national trade group in boulder, colo. craft breweries in 2013 continued to open at "a rate of more than one per day," according to the organization. "you can't overlook that trend," said mr. o'hara. "more bars are focused on high-quality drinks — quality alcohol, quality craft beers and distilleries and good wines." — stephanie ritenbaugh: sritenbaugh@post-gazette.com or 412-263-4910. post-gazette’s special section “in the lead” will come out thursday, may 15, 2014 first published may 14, 2014 12:00 am get unlimited digital access - web, mobile, tablet, apps and more. join the conversation: commenting policy | how to report abuse to report inappropriate comments, abuse and/or repeat offenders, please send an email to socialmedia@post-gazette.com and include a link to the article and a copy of the comment. your report will be reviewed in a timely manner.  		thank you. commenting policy | how to report abuse your e-mail: your name: friends e-mail: friends name: message: captcha submit advertisement latest in in the lead 2014 - stories in the lead:  pittsburgh leads with the most bars per person 1 day ago in the lead: low vacancy recorded in downtown pittsburgh 1 day ago in the lead: overview / we sure love lists 1 day ago in the lead: banking on the future in pittsburgh 2 days ago in the lead: retaining talent the new challenge for pittsburgh area companies 2 days ago in the lead: marcellus offers stunning shale play 2 days ago advertisement advertisement login with your social network: or, login here: email: forgot password password: don‘t have an account yet? click here register with your social network or, create new account email: * confirm  email: * first name: * password: * last name: * re-enter password: * i have read and understood the terms of use * have an account already? click here we still need some details from you... year of birth: * 1920 1921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 1927 1928 1929 1930 1931 1932 1933 1934 1935 1936 1937 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 gender: * male female zip code: * i have read and understood the terms of use * we found your email in our system. please provide your site password to link to your existing account. or click here to create new account email: password: forgot password please enter your email address to reset your password email: to login with a different account click here an email regarding your password change has been sent to your email address. we have not verified that the email belongs to you. please check your inbox for         the verification email. to resend the verification email, please enter your email address and click submit. email: to login with a different account click here a confirmation email has been sent to you with a link to activate the account. login here: email: password: you have 2 remaining free articles this month try unlimited digital access subscribe log in if you are an existing subscriber, link your account for free access. start here not yet you’ve reached the limit of free articles this month. to continue unlimited reading subscribe log in if you are an existing subscriber, link your account for free access. start here pittsburgh post-gazette home news local sports opinion a & e life business video photo classifieds jobs circulars cars real estate pg store weddings contact us site map media kit 34 allies about us rss feeds corrections technical help? products & services terms of use privacy policy pg sites: sports blogs powersource staff blogs community voices early returns sportstown pittsburgh mom the digs special projects pg plate social media: twitter: news customer care facebook pinterest google+ print: home delivery rates back copies newsstand electronic: pge press copyright © 1997—2014 pg publishing co., inc. all rights reserved.
