as far as a chemical control goes, this is what penn state university has. spotted lanternfly management and pesticide safety article chemical treatment cost prohibited and non-effective in long run systemic control, injection, $15 an inch of trunk diameter, so for example a 10 inch street tree would cost around $150.00 and wouldn't help with the lanternflies on nearby grape vines and porcelain berry, so it would have a primarily cosmetic effect for a couple of weeks. it would take months to inject all of the trees, by which point the season would be coming to a close. foliar spraying would be faster, but significantly more dangerous to both the safety of our water supplies, native insect and reptile species, pets, and park-users, and pedestrians, as it would involve essentially fogging the forest or streets with insecticides. it would work for a couple of weeks, and then they would move in from the surrounding infected parts of the county and city and we'd be back to square one. i don't really have a price estimate for foliar work, as it is done by time and materials. pittsburgh urban forest discover how pittsburgh enhances its neighborhoods with trees. from urban forest
