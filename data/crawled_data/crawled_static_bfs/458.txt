procurement pgh lab sustainability about city planning the department of city planning works with partners to plan and deliver a vision for the city’s future grounded in a just transition we work to create and maintain an orderly, timely, environmentally-sustainable, and consistent approach to land use and development within the city. to achieve this end, planning works with communities, civic organizations and public entities to develop long-term plans to sustain and revitalize a thriving city of neighborhoods for the people who live, work, learn and visit here. mission the department of city planning is a convener of residents, communities, civic organizations, commissions, and public entities, and works with these partners to plan and deliver a vision for the city’s future grounded in a just transition. the department works at the intersection of climate change, racial justice, and social equity to ensure healthy, safe and vibrant neighborhoods for all residents. because the built environment plays a vital role in the lives of pittsburgh residents, city planning incorporates policies and activities that promote sustainability, climate resilience, design justice, arts and culture, housing affordability and economic opportunity in the development and implementation of the city’s comprehensive plan, neighborhood plans, land use policies, zoning regulations, approval of development projects, and coordination of community development programs and partnerships. the department is committed to focusing core planning activities to prioritize neighborhoods that have been harmed by past planning policies and practices which have contributed to existing racial and economic inequities throughout the city. this effort requires deeper engagement and additional resources in the development of plans and policies, working to remove barriers to the department’s services, and by recognizing a more holistic set of metrics to advance the wellbeing of our diverse communities. the department of city planning recognizes the power of residents to transform their neighborhoods and calls on us to use that power to shape the future of pittsburgh. integrated planning division the
