acts as a network of smart thermostats, adjusting the climate in every room. before entering the program, the company had only piloted their product in residential facilities. while participating in the program, the company was able to test its new technology at a larger scale on the 11th floor of the ross street building where the urban redevelopment authority (ura) is located. by learning about the ura’s hvac system, hibersense discovered that the local authority could potentially save 20% in energy savings. startup: transitsource partner: department of planning, city of pittsburgh pilot program: transitsource was one of the three startups in the first cohort of pgh lab. the startup piloted its sentinel boxes, a bike-mounted piece of hardware that detects and reports close calls for cyclists, or events where a motor-vehicle narrowly passes a bicycle. the device interfaces with the cyclist's smartphone to record gps location, time of day, passing distance, moving speed of the passing vehicle and a picture of the event.  the startup tested its sentinel box on one of pittsburgh’s busiest streets, negley avenue. with the help of four dedicated volunteers, the seven-week pilot program yielded a total of 239 trips equal to 65 miles on the road. this was the first time the sentinel boxes were tested on a larger scale. transitsource reported that of the 7,604 passing events, 2,500 were within four feet of the bicyclist which, in the state of pennsylvania, that is considered to be an ‘unsafe pass’. results from the pilot period concluded that 1 in 3 passing events were not only unsafe, but unlawful. startup: cleanrobotics partner: department of public works, city of pittsburgh pilot program: the startup company tested its flagship product, the trashbot. the trashbot uses advanced robotics and artificial intelligence to sort recyclables from waste at the point of disposal. this process drastically increases the recycling yield and improves its quality through reduced contamination. in coordination with the office of environmental services, the trashbot was placed on the first floor of the city-county building. the first floor of the city-county building provided an ideal location to test the trashbot and its use as it is a highly transited area. the trashbot was tested for one week. in addition, the startup was able to run surveys that tested the look and feel of the trashbot. startup: kaarta partner: department of public works, city of pittsburgh pilot program: kaarta tested its 3d scanning technology that blends multiple advanced sensors — a 360° lidar laser scanner, a motion sensor, and a feature tracker — to survey its environment and accurately determine where it is and what’s around it. the startup tested its 3d scanner technology in two different settings with the help of the department of public works at the city of pittsburgh. their case studies included an abandoned building where the company used its technology to show the extent of the interior damage and site components and a department of public works warehouse to map the location of inventory in the building. read more about this pilot here. startup: mellonhead lab partner: pittsburgh water and sewer authority (pwsa) pilot program: the startup company tested its cattfish water sensor with the pittsburgh water and sewer authority (pwsa). the sensor is used by

company gained access to a water plant owned by pwsa to test its larger size water quality sensor called flamingo. the startup company was able to gain and report data to pwsa regarding the water quality of one of its plants. < startup: netbeez partner: department of innovation & performance, city of pittsburgh pilot program: netbeez’s technology allows for early off-site detection — therefore
