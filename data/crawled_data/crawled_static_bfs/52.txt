(beth hatfutsot, the oster visual documentation center) pittsburgh has also been at the epicenter of some of the most significant moments in jewish history. the 1885 pittsburgh platform, which laid out the major principles of classical american reform judaism, became a major source of controversy. the pittsburgh platform sought to emphasize the american reform movement’s embrace of modernity, but it proved to be divisive; its attitude towards jewish law was one of the major factors that contributed to the schism that resulted in the formation of the conservative movement, and it was deeply upsetting to zionists who wanted the movement to acknowledge the importance of a jewish homeland. a number of other platforms would be adopted by the reform movement—including another pittsburgh platform in 1999—as the american reform movement grew and redefined its philosophies, but for both the platform’s advocates and its critics, pittsburgh remained a pivotal location in american jewish history. the importance of this moment in jewish and pittsburgh history was given formal acknowledgement in 2007, when the pennsylvania historical and museum commission erected a marker commemorating the event. pittsburgh platform plaque outside concordia club in the city, where the [platform was created (creative commons, wikimedia) and yet, in spite of the controversies, the jewish community of pittsburgh ultimately emerged as an example of jewish coexistence. squirrel hill, which became the hub of jewish life, and murray avenue, the heart of jewish pittsburgh, is home to over 20 synagogues spanning the major jewish movements, as well as kosher supermarkets and restaurants. from rodef shalom and the tree of life synagogue, pittsburgh’s oldest congregations, to the newest independent minyanim, from the yeshivas to the community schools, from the art museums to the memorials, pittsburgh’s jewish community has been a model for jewish diversity and community support. for hundreds of years the jewish community of pittsburgh has been home to inspiring individuals, creative communities, and jewish innovation. as we reach out in support during its time of tragedy, we can also look to it and see what a strong, vibrant jewish community looks like. a clip from “murray avenue: a community in transition”: “murray avenue: a community in transition”, pittsburgh, 1989 the museum of the jewish people at beit hatfutsot the oster visual documentation center courtesy of sheila chamovitz standing together with pittsburgh!
